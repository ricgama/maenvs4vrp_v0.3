MAEnvs4VRP
===========

MAEnvs4VRP is a library made up of multi-agent environments for simulating classic vehicle routing problems.
The library provides:

* A flexible modular architecture.
* Design that allows easy customization.
* Incorporation of new routing problems.

In order to narrow the current gap between the test beds for algorithm benchmarking used in Reinforcement Learning and Operations Research (OR) communities, the library allows a straightforward integration of classical OR benchmark
instances.

If you want to have a grasp of the basics about the library, you can check our `quickstart <content/start.html>`_.
